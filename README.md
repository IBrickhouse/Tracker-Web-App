# Tracker Web App

The idea for this is to allow for tracking of a sepecific bad habit and allow the user to track how many times they engages with that habit. In a similar way to how calorie counting programs work, a budget that aligns with the ultimate goal of the user will be computed and then the user will be given a suggested daily limit. Each day will add up and then they will be given a weekly summary of how the week went. If they engaged in the habit more or less than what is suggested to meet the goal, they will be reminded accordingy.
